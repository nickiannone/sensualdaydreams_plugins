# sensualdaydreams_plugins
A suite of custom Wordpress plugins for the Sensual Daydreams website.

This project is meant to facilitate extended development for the website of the Milwaukee Rocky Horror Picture Show 
shadowcast, Sensual Daydreams. Since we are switching to use Wordpress, there are a few things we need developed to
ensure that our site retains the original functionality we desire. This project intends to include all of these, as
well as documentation regarding their design and implementation. Woo!
